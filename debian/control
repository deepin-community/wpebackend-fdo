Description: WPE backend for FreeDesktop.org - Development files
 WPE WebKit is a port of the WebKit browser engine optimized for
 embedded devices. The code itself is hardware-agnostic, and the
 platform-specific bits are implemented in backends.
 .
 wpebackend-fdo provides a reference WPE backend implementation using
 FreeDesktop.org technologies (Wayland protocol and the Wayland EGL
 platform) to enable integration into the WPE WebKit process model.
 .
 In addition to WPE WebKit, wpebackend-fdo is also used by WebKitGTK
 to implement hardware-accelerated rendering under Wayland.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
